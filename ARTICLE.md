> The argument that 90% of software engineering is just about writing APIs overlooks the broader role of an engineer. Much like a firefighter isn't just a hose operator, a software engineer isn't simply writing code, it's about meeting business requirements, ensuring functionality, and collaborating in a larger team. Frameworks and APIs standardize processes to promote effective teamwork and ease onboarding. Without them, engineers would be reinventing the wheel, creating isolated systems that would be hard to maintain or expand, especially as the scale of the software grows.
